# noverlap
prevent function invocations (both sync and async) from redundantly overlapping with each other

## usage

first import `noverlap`
```bash
yarn add noverlap
```
```js
import noverlap from 'noverlap';
```

then instantiate a `noverlap` instance
```js
const debounce = noverlap();
```

or instantiate `noverlap` with custom configurations:
- `hash`: a function that generate a hash given the wrapped function's arguments
- `comparator`: a function that determines whether or not a hash has already been added as a key when looking through the map's keys. useful for when you've lost the reference to certain keys (eg storing objects or arrays as keys). defaults to the [`sameValueZero` algorithm which is used by `Map.prototype.has`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map#Key_equality)

- `wait`: the timer duration in milliseconds that will start on each execution of an async function and reset with every overlapping execution
- `start`: a callback (provided with the wrapped function's arguments) that will be synchronously executed right before the wrapped function
- `queue`: a callback that gets fired when a function execution has been added to the queue that will be eventually flushed
- `beforeFinish`: a callback that gets fired right before the wrapped function finally gets called and the queue gets flushed
- `success`: a callback that gets fired when the redundantly invoked function was resolved
- `fail`: a callback that gets fired when the redundantly invoked function was rejected
- `finish`: a callback (provided with the return value of the wrapped function) that will be fired after the wrapped function

the following are the default configurations:
```js
const defaultDebounce = noverlap({
  /** the first parameter will be considered the hash of the function execution */
  hash: (...args) => args[0],

  /** find a direct reference to the hash that will be looked up as the key in map.get(key) */
  comparator: (hash, existingKey) => { /* 'SameValueZero' algorithm */ },

  /** wait 420ms to see if another execution of the async function is overlapping with an existing one */
  wait: 420,
})
```

the following are not included by default but can be added manually during `noverlap` instantiation (these manual additions get merged with the default configurations)
```js
const customDebounce = noverlap({
  start(payload) { console.log('a function has just been hashed', payload) },
  beforeFinish(payload) { console.log('about to execute the function with a payload of', payload) },
  finish(returnValue) { console.log('the redundantly invoked function returned', returnValue) },
});
```

you can also use a function or promise that is provided with the wrapped function's parameters to construct a `noverlap` instance's configs
```js
const debounce = noverlap((...args) => /* noverlap configs */);
const debounce = noverlap(async (...args) => /* noverlap configs */);
```

let's use this dummy async function that we pretend makes a fetch to a server. we do not want this fetcher to make the same call multiple times in a row when in fact we only need the data from the latest call, which should return the most up to date response
```js
const dummyFetcher = payload => new Promise((resolve, reject) => setTimeout(() => resolve(payload)));
```

apply the noverlap instance to an async function by wrapping it
```js
const debounce = noverlap();
const fetchSomeData = debounce(async payload => {
  const response = await dummyFetcher(payload);
  console.log('this async function will only be executed once even if it is called with the same payload multiple times within 420ms');
  return response;
});
```

now, using `fetchSomeData` like this:
```js
const redundantAsyncExecution = async n => console.log(
  `result from execution #${n} with a redundantly repeated fetch using ${
    await fetchSomeData('this payload')
  } ðŸ¤¯`
);
redundantAsyncExecution(1);
redundantAsyncExecution(2);
redundantAsyncExecution(3);
```

will log:
```
this async function will only be executed once even if it is called with the same payload multiple times within 420ms
result from execution #1 with a redundantly repeated fetch using this payload ðŸ¤¯
result from execution #2 with a redundantly repeated fetch using this payload ðŸ¤¯
result from execution #3 with a redundantly repeated fetch using this payload ðŸ¤¯
```
